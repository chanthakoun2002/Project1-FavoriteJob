                        <h4>My Background working at Amazon</h4>
                        <p>I started working at amazon in the year of 2021 and ended my time there in 2022, I worked in a warehouse for
                            amazon online fresh deliveries in a warehouse near downtown Seattle. working at amazon the tasks I had to do 
                            was very varied, from completing orders for customers to training new employees there were many things I was 
                            expected to do and what I could not do I was taught what to do and how to do them accurately and efficiently.
                            but eventually my time at amazon evetually came to an end by the summer of 2022 but i would allways
                            remember the skills that i learned while working at amazon.

                <p>While I learned many skills during my time working at amazon the skills I value the most
                    were time management and leadership, when I started working at amazon I was terrible at managing 
                    my time and working with deadlines but with time I was able to become proficient at managing my time 
                    and my time at amazon also taught me how to be a team leader and how to effectively work with others as a 
                    team leader.
